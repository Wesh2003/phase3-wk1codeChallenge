# Phase 3 - Week 1 Code Challenge


<p> 

There are three tasks being conducted in this **Phase 3- WWeek 1 Code Challenge** project which are:


<ul>
    <li> Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time</li>
    <li> Two numbers are positive.</li>
    <li> Consonant value </li>
</ul>

</p>

### Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time
<p>

This task is conducted in the **time.py** file. This tasks requires a person to be able to convert any time written in 12 hour format into 24 hour format e.g 2.pm should coonvert to 14,00 pm 

</p>

### Two numbers are positive.
<p>

This task is conducted in the **positive_numbers.py**file. This task requires that a person input three numbers (a,b,c) and if two of the numbers are greater than 0, it should return True otherwise it returns False

</p>

### Consonant value
<p>

This task is conducted in the **consonant.py** file. This task requires that a person links each letter of the alphabet to a number starting from 1 in ascending order e.g (a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, .... z = 26). After which they will be able to obtain the highest value present in a written string e.g "zodiacs" = 26 since z = 26

</p>

## Technology used 
The technologies used in this project are

<ul>
    <li>
    <strong>python</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
